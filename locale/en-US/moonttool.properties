jsfix.title=Moon Tester Tool :: Workaround for detecting the browser version
jsfix.text=The extension to be installed contains code to detect the browser version. In some cases this can cause it to not work properly in Pale Moon 29.0 and later.\n\nMoon Tester Tool can try to fix this issue, but the workaround it applies has its own drawbacks, so it is recommended that you try to do without it first.\n\nDo you want to apply the workaround for detecting the browser version?\n\n
